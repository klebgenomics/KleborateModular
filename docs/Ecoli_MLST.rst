*Escherichia coli* Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST)
---------------------------------------------------------

*Escherichia coli* is a commensal bacteria known to be a part of normal intestinal flora but can also be the cause of intestinal and extraintestinal illness in humans. The *E. coli* subtypes are identified according to their O and H antigens. The O antigen is determined by a repeating polysaccharide chain present in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) outer membrane, and the flagellum determines the H antigen.

Genomes identified by Kleborate as belonging to the *Escherichia coli* species are subjected to MLST using the `Achtman <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1557465/>`_ and Pasteur schemes.

Pasteur schemes are described at the  *Escherichia coli* `\BIGSdb hosted at the Pasteur Institute <https://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/ecoli/>`_. Please see `here <https://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/ecoli/references/>`_ for more details. 

The *E. coli* MLST scheme uses internal fragments of the following seven house-keeping genes:


* adk (adenylate kinase)
* fumC (fumarate hydratase)
* gyrB (DNA gyrase)
* icd (isocitrate/isopropylmalate dehydrogenase)
* mdh (malate dehydrogenase)
* purA (adenylosuccinate dehydrogenase)
* recA (ATP/GTP binding motif)
