**************************************
Modules
**************************************


Kleborate v3 includes a range of modules for typing bacterial genomes, most of which are specific to a particular species or complex (*Klebsiella pneumoniae SC*, *Klebsiella oxytoca SC*, *Escherichia coli*). We therefore recommend specifying a preset list of modules to run based on the organism, rather than specifying individual modules. This will run the species detection module first, and if the species matches that specified in --preset, the preset modules for that species will be run (if not, the species will be reported and the remaining fields will be blank). 

Details of the available modules, how they work, and how to interpret the outputs, are given below.

General modules
===============

Species detection
-----------------

``-m enterobacterales__species``


This module will attempt to identify the species of each input assembly. It does this by comparing the assembly using `Mash <https://mash.readthedocs.io/>`_ to a curated set of *Klebsiella* and other *Enterobacteriaceae* assemblies from NCBI, and reporting the species of the closest match. 

Parameters
++++++++++++++

``--enterobacterales__species_strong``

Mash distance threshold for a strong species match (default: 0.02)

``--enterobacterales__species_weak``

Mash distance threshold for a weak species match (default: 0.04)

Outputs
+++++++

Output of the species typing module is the following columns:

.. list-table::

   * - species
     - Species name (scientific name)

   * - species_match
     - Strength of the species call indicated as ``strong``\  (Mash distance ≤ 0.02) or ``weak``\  (Mash distance of > 0.02 and ≤ 0.04, may be novel or hybrid species)

The quality and completeness of Kleborate results depends on the quality of the input genome assemblies. In general, you can expect good results from draft genomes assembled with tools like SPAdes from high-depth (>50x) Illumina data, however it is always possible that key genes subject to genotyping may be split across contigs, which can create problems for detecting and typing them accurately.

Contig stats
------------

.. code-block:: Python

   -m general__contig_stats

This module generates some basic assembly statistics to help users understand their typing results in the context of assembly quality, although we recommend users conduct more comprehensive QC themselves before typing genomes (e.g. screen for contamination, etc).

The module reports a standard set of assembly quality metrics (see Outputs below).


It will also flag in the ``QC_warnings``\  column if an assembly size falls outside those specified in the ``species_specification.txt``\  in the module directory, or if N50 <10 kbp or ambiguous bases (Ns) are detected in the sequence.

Outputs
+++++++

Output of the contig stats module is the following columns:

.. list-table::

   * - contig_count
     - Number of contigs in the input assembly

   * - N50
     - `N50 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N50,_L50,_and_related_statistics>`_ calculated from the contig sizes

   * - largest_contig
     - Size of largest contig (in bp)

   * - total_size
     - Total assembly size (in bp)

   * - ambiguous_bases
     - Detection of ambiguous bases (yes or no). If yes, the number of ambiguous bases is also provided in brackets.

   * - QC_warnings
     - List of QC issues detected, including: ``ambiguous_bases``\ (ambiguous bases detected) ``N50``\ (N50 < 10 kbp), ``total_size`` (genome size falls outside expected range).


Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex
=====================================

.. code-block:: Python

   --preset kpsc

These modules will be run if the ``enterobacterales__species``\   module confirms the input assembly as a member of the *K. pneumoniae* species complex (KpSC) labelled in the tree below. 

We've included the phylogroup numbers in the table below for backwards compatibility with older literature, but these names are not used in the Kleborate output. See `this review <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-019-0315-1>`_ for an overview of the species complex.

KpSC MLST
---------

.. code-block:: Python

   -m klebsiella_pneumo_complex__mlst

Genomes identified by Kleborate as belonging to the *K. pneumoniae* species complex are subjected to MLST using the 7-locus scheme described at the  *K. pneumoniae* `\Bacteria Isolate Genome Sequence Database hosted at the Pasteur Institute <http://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/klebsiella/klebsiella.html>`_. Note that this scheme is not specific to *K. pneumoniae sensu stricto* but covers the whole species complex. 

A copy of the MLST alleles and ST definitions is stored in the **/data** directory of this module.

Rhinoscleromatis and Ozaenae
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *K. pneumoniae* clonal group CG67 is known as *K. pneumoniae* subsp. *rhinoscleromatis* because it causes rhinoscleroma (chronic granulomatous infection of the nose and upper airways), and clonal group CG91 is known as *K. pneumoniae* subsp. *ozaenae* as it can cause ozena (atrophic rhinitis). To alert users to this, when STs belonging to these clonal groups are detected by Kleborate this is flagged in the ST column, e.g. 'ST67 (subsp. rhinoscleromatis)' or 'ST97 (subsp. ozaenae)'. 

The relevant STs are:

.. list-table::

   * - **Species column**
     - **ST**
     - **MLST column**
   * - *K. pneumoniae*
     - 67, 68, 69, 3772, 3819
     - ST67 (subsp. rhinoscleromatis)
   * - *K. pneumoniae*
     - 90, 91, 92, 93, 95, 96, 97, 381, 777, 3193
       3766, 3768, 3771, 3781, 3782, 3784, 3802, 3803
     - ST91 (subsp. ozaenae)

Parameters
++++++++++

``--klebsiella_pneumo_complex__mlst_min_identity``

Minimum alignment percent identity for klebsiella_pneumo_complex_MLST (default: 90.0)

``--klebsiella_pneumo_complex__mlst_min_coverage`` 

Minimum alignment percent coverage for klebsiella_pneumo_complex_MLST (default: 80.0)

``--klebsiella_pneumo_complex__mlst_required_exact_matches`` 

At least this many exact matches are required to call an ST (default: 3)


Outputs
+++++++

Output of the KpSC MLST module is the following columns:

.. list-table::

   * - ST
     - sequence type

   * - gapA, infB, mdh, pgi, phoE, rpoB, tonB
     - allele number

* Kleborate makes an effort to report the closest matching ST if a precise match is not found.
* Imprecise allele matches are indicated with a ``*``.
* Imprecise ST calls are indicated with ``-nLV``\ , where n indicates the number of loci that disagree with the ST reported. So ``258-1LV`` indicates a single-locus variant (SLV) of ST258, i.e. 6/7 loci match ST258.


KpSC virulence modules
----------------------

Typing modules are available five key acquired virulence loci that are associated with invasive infections and are found at high prevalence among hypervirulent *K. pneumoniae* strains: the siderophores yersiniabactin (\ *ybt*\ ), aerobactin (\ *iuc*\ ) and salmochelin (\ *iro*\ ), the genotoxin colibactin (\ *clb*\ ), and the hypermucoidy locus *rmpADC*. Each of these loci comprises multiple genes and will only be reported if >50% of the genes are detected. 

There is also a module to screen for the alternative hypermucoidy marker gene *rmpA2*.

For each module, if the target locus is detected, the typer will:

* Call a sequence type using the same logic as for 7-gene MLST
* Report the phylogenetic lineage associated with each sequence type, as outlined below and detailed in the corresponding papers
* Report the structural variant of the mobile genetic element that is usually associated with that phylogenetic lineage (for *ybt* and *iuc* only)

The *ybt*\ , *clb*\ , *iuc*\ , *iro* and *rmpADC* locus-specific ST schemes are defined in the *K. pneumoniae* `Bacterial Isolate Genome Sequence Database <https://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/klebsiella/>`_. 

Notes on virulence allele reporting:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Virulence alleles are treated in the same way as [MLST] alleles:

* In order to consider a Minimap2 hit, it must exceed both 80% identity and 40% coverage (adjustable via the --min_spurious_identity and --min_spurious_coverage options).
* Hits that fail to meet 90% identity and 80% coverage (adjustable via the ``--min_identity`` and ``--min_coverage`` options) are reported in the ``spurious_virulence_hits`` column but not used for sequence typing.
* Imperfect hits (either <100% identity or <100% coverage) are reported with a ``*``. E.g. ``15*`` means that no perfect match was found but the closest match is allele 15.
* KleborateModular will next translate the hit into amino acid sequence and look for truncations (expressed as % amino acid length from the start codon). If the result is less than 90%, it is added to the result (e.g. ``15*-42%``\ ).

Notes on virulence sequence type reporting:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Virulence locus STs are only reported if >50% of the genes in a locus are detected (e.g. at least 6 of the 11 *ybt* locus genes are required to report a *ybt* ST).
* If <50% of the genes in a locus are detected, KleborateModular reports the ST as ``0`` and the lineage as ``-``.
* If <100% but >50% of the genes in a locus are detected, KleborateModular will report the locus as (incomplete), along with the closest matching ST and its corresponding phylogenetic lineage. E.g. if only 7 of the 11 *ybt* genes are detected, this will be reported as ``ybtX; ICEKpX (incomplete)``.
* For genomes with multiple copies of a virulence locus (e.g. a strain that carries ICE *Kp1* and the KpVP-1 plasmid will have two copies of *iro* and *rmp*\ ), KleborateModular will report and assign a ST or closest matching ST to each of these virulence loci provided that the locus is relatively intact in the genome (i.e. >50% of the genes in a locus are present on a single contig) and according to the above criteria.  

Yersiniabactin and colibactin
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: Python

   -m klebsiella_pneumo_complex__ybst, klebsiella_pneumo_complex__cbst

We previously explored the diversity of the *K. pneumoniae* integrative conjugative element (ICE *Kp*), which mobilises the yersiniabactin locus *ybt*, using genomic analysis of a diverse set of 2498 *Klebsiella* (see `this article <http://mgen.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/mgen/10.1099/mgen.0.000196>`_\ ). Overall, we found *ybt* in about a third of all *K. pneumoniae* genomes (and *clb* in about 14%). We identified 17 distinct lineages of *ybt* (see figure) embedded within 14 structural variants of ICE *Kp* that can integrate at any of four tRNA-Asn sites in the chromosome. One type was found to be plasmid-borne. Based on this analysis, we developed a MLST-style approach for assigning yersiniabactin sequence types (YbST) and colibactin sequence types (CbST), which is implemented in KleborateModular. 

Note that while ICE *Kp1* is occasionally found in other species within the KpSC, and even in other genera of Enterobacteriaceae (see `original paper <http://mgen.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/mgen/10.1099/mgen.0.000196>`_\ ), most of the known variation included in the database is derived from *K. pneumoniae*.

The allele databases and schemes were last updated in April 2024.

Aerobactin and salmochelin
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: Python

   -m klebsiella_pneumo_complex__abst, klebsiella_pneumo_complex__smst

We further explored the genetic diversity of the aerobactin (\ *iuc*\ ) and salmochelin (\ *iro*\ ) loci among a dataset of 2733 *Klebsiella* genomes (see `this publication <https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-018-0587-5>`_\ ). We identified five *iro* and six *iuc* lineages (see figure), each of which was associated with a specific location within *K. pneumoniae* genomes (primarily virulence plasmids). Based on this analysis, we developed a MLST-style approach for assigning aerobactin sequence types (AbST) and salmochelin sequence types (SmST) which is implemented in Kleborate. 

* The most common lineages are *iuc1* and *iro1*\ , which are found together on the FIBk virulence plasmid KpVP-1 (typified by pK2044 or pLVPK common to the hypervirulent clones ST23, ST86, etc). 
* *iuc2* and *iro2* lineages were associated with the alternative FIBk virulence plasmid KpVP-2 (typified by Kp52.145 plasmid II from the K2 ST66 lab strain known as Kp52.145 or CIP 52.145 or B5055). 
* *iuc5* and *iro5* originate from *E. coli* and are carried (often together) on *E. coli* FII plasmids that can transfer to *K. pneumoniae*. 
* The lineages *iuc2A*\ , *iuc3* and *iro4* were associated with other novel FIBk plasmids that had not been previously described in *K. pneumoniae*\ , but sequences for which are included in `the paper <https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-018-0587-5>`_. 
* The salmochelin locus present in ICE *Kp1* constitutes its own lineage *iro3*\ , and the aerobactin locus present in the chromosome of ST67 *K. pneumoniae* subsp *rhinoscleromatis* strains constitutes its own lineage *iuc4*. 

Note on *iucA* sequence update:
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In Kleborate version 2.2.0 and earlier, the majority of *iucA* alleles had a sequence length of 1791 bp, with the exception being those associated with lineage *iuc 5* which have a length of 1725 bp. Related to this, *iucA* in genomes with *iuc 3* encoded a premature stop codon resulting in a significantly truncated and presumably non-functional IucA protein (i.e. at 2% length of the intact amino acid sequence), despite experimental evidence showing siderophore activity in *iuc 3*\ + isolates. In light of this evidence, the sequences of *iucA* genes with the longer ~1791 bp length were updated to ~1725 bp by removing the first 66 bp. These changes are captured in Kleborate version 2.3.0 onwards, and address the truncation issue in *iuc 3*\ + genomes. The following *iucA* alleles and AbST profiles have also been retired due to sequence redundancy following the update:

* alleles: _iucA\ *48*\ , _iucA\ *49*\ , _iucA\ *52*
* profiles: AbST 70, 82, 83

The allele databases and schemes were last updated in April 2024.

Hypermucoidy loci
""""""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: Python

   -m klebsiella__rmst

The *rmpA* locus is associated with the hypermucoidy phenotype that is a virulence feature that is often observed in hypervirulent *K. pneumoniae* strains. Recent work has revealed that *rmpA* serves as a transcriptional regulator for the *rmpD* and *rmpC* genes, and together these genes comprise the *rmpADC* (or *rmp*\ ) locus. *rmpC* is involved in the upregulation of capsule expression while *rmpD* drives hypermucoviscosity (see the paper on `rmpC <https://mbio.asm.org/content/10/2/e00089-19>`_ and this one on `rmpD <https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/5/e01750-20>`_ for more information.) 

In light of this information, we screened and extracted the *rmpA*\ , *rmpD* and *rmpC* sequences from the 2733 genomes included in the aerobactin and salmochelin study, and generated a RmST typing scheme. We observed four distinct *rmp* lineages, which were associated with the KpVP-1 (\ *rmp 1*\ ), KpVP-2 (\ *rmp 2*\ ), *iuc2A* virulence plasmids (\ *rmp 2A*\ ) and ICE *Kp1* (rmp 3). The details of this novel virulence typing scheme have not yet been published. 

The rmpA module screens for *rmpADC* and will report a sequence type, along with the associated lineage and mobile genetic element

Note:
"""""

* Alleles for each gene are sourced from the `BIGSdb-pasteur <https://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/klebsiella/>`_\ , while additional *rmpA* alleles have also been added to Kleborate.
* The *rmpA* and *rmpA2* genes share ~83% nucleotide identity so are easily distinguished.
* Unique (non-overlapping) nucleotide Minimap2 hits with >95% identity and >50% coverage are reported. Note multiple hits to the same gene are reported if found. E.g. the NTUH-K2044 genome carries *rmpA* in the virulence plasmid and also in ICE *Kp1* , which is reported in the *rmpA* column as ``rmpA_11(ICEKp1),rmpA_2(KpVP-1)``.
* As with the other virulence genes, truncations in the *rmpA* and *rmpA2* genes are expressed as a percentage of the amino acid length from the start codon, e.g. ``rmpA_5-54%`` indicates the RmpA protein is truncated after 54% length of the intact amino acid sequence. These truncations appear to be common, due to insertions and deletions within a poly-G tract, and almost certainly result in loss of protein function.


rmst Parameters

KpSC AMR
--------

.. code-block:: Python

   -m klebsiella_pneumo_complex__amr

Acquired AMR genes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module screens input genomes against a curated version of the `CARD database <https://card.mcmaster.ca/>`_ of acquired resistance gene alleles (see the following `spreadsheet <https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/CARD_v3_0_8_AMR_database_curation_for_Kleborate/13256759>`_ for details on curation), and groups these by drug class for reporting purposes. The chromosomal *fosA* and *oqxAB* genes that are intrinsic to all KpSC are not reported and usually do not confer fosfomycin/fluoroquinolone resistance in these species.

Kleborate has logic to choose the best allele hit, annotate that hit with extra information and place it in an approprirate column in the output.

In brief:

* Exact nucleotide matches are preferred, followed by exact amino acid matches, followed by inexact nucleotide matches.
* Annotations indicate aspects of the hit: ``^`` (inexact nucleotide but exact amino acid match), ``*`` (inexact nucleotide and inexact amino acid match), ``?`` (incomplete match) and ``-X%`` (truncated amino acid sequence).
* The column indicates the confidence of the hit: strong hits go in the column for their drug class, truncated hits go in the ``truncated_resistance_hits`` column and low identity/coverage hits go in the ``spurious_resistance_hits`` column.

And here is the logic in more detail:

* In order to consider a Minimap hit, it must exceed both 80% identity and 40% coverage (adjustable via the ``--min_spurious_identity`` and ``--min_spurious_coverage`` options).
* If the hit is 100% identity and 100% coverage, then it will be reported with no further annotation (e.g. ``TEM-15``\ ).
* If no exact nucleotide match is found, Kleborate searches for an exact amino acid match, and will report this with a ``^`` symbol. E.g. ``TEM-15^`` indicates an exact match to the TEM-15 protein sequence but with one or more nucleotide differences.
* If no exact amino acid match is found, the closest nucleotide match is reported with a ``*`` symbol. E.g. ``TEM-15*`` indicates no precise nucleotide or amino acid match is found, but the closest nucleotide match is to TEM-15.
* If the hit is less than 100% coverage, a ``?`` is added to the result E.g. ``TEM-15?`` indicates an incomplete match at 100% identity, and ``TEM-15*?`` indicates an incomplete match at <100% identity.
* Kleborate will next translate the hit into amino acid sequence and look for truncations (expressed as % amino acid length from the start codon). If the result is less than 90%, it is added to the result (e.g. ``TEM-15*-42%``\ ) and the hit is reported in the ``truncated_resistance_hits`` column.
* If the hit is less than 90% identity or 80% nucleotide coverage (adjustable via the ``--min_identity`` and ``--min_coverage`` options), it is reported in the ``spurious_resistance_hits`` column. Otherwise, it is reported in the column for its drug class (e.g. ``Bla_ESBL_acquired``\ ).

Note that Kleborate reports resistance results for all antimicrobial classes with confidently attributable resistance mechanisms in KpSC. Not all of these are actually used clinically for treatment of KpSC infections (e.g. MLS, Rif) but they are still reported as the presence of acquired resistance determinants to these classes is of interest to researchers for other reasons (e.g. these genes can be useful markers of MGEs and MGE spread; there is potential for use of these drugs against other organisms to select for KpSC in co-infected patients or in the environment). For an overview of antimicrobial resistance and consensus definitions of multidrug resistance (MDR), extensive drug resistance (XDR) and pan drug resistance in Enterobacteriaceae, see `Magiorakos 2012 <https://www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com/article/S1198-743X(1461632-3/fulltext)>`_\ 

SHV beta-lactamases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All KpSC carry a core chromosomal beta-lactamase gene (SHV in *K. pneumoniae*\ , LEN in *K. variicola*\ , OKP in *K. quasipneumoniae*\ ) that confers clinically significant resistance to ampicillin. Some KpSC also carry acquired mobile SHV alleles, which can confer additional inhibitor resistance and/or resistance to extended spectrum beta-lactams.

Kleborate will report all of the SHV alleles it detects and separate them into columns based on the resistance phenotype they are predicted to encode:

* SHV alleles associated with ampicillin resistance only, will be reported in the ``Bla_chr`` column because they are assumed to represent the chromosomal allele. These genes are not included in the count of acquired resistance genes or drug classes.
* Other SHV alleles e.g. those predicted to encode ESBLs (extended-spectrum beta-lactamases) or beta-lactamases with inhibitor resistance will be reported in the relevant ``Bla_ESBL_acquired`` or ``Bla_inhR_acquired`` columns etc (see below), because these SHV alleles are almost always carried on plasmids. (However it is possible to have a mutation in a chromosomal SHV gene that gives a match to an ESBL allele, which would also be reported in the ``Bla_ESBL_acquired`` column and counted as an acquired gene because it is very hard to tell the difference without manual exploration of the genetic context.)

The specific mutations, and assignment of alleles to class, is detailed in this preprint from KlebNET-GSP: `Tsang et al, 2024 BioRxiv <https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.05.587953>`_.


Additional chromosomal mutations associated with AMR
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Fluoroquinolone resistance mutations: GyrA 83 & 87 and ParC 80 & 84. These appear in the ``Flq_mutations`` column.
* Colistin resistance due to truncation or loss of core genes MgrB or PmrB. If these genes are missing or truncated, this information will be reported in the 'Col_mutations' column (truncations are expressed as % amino acid length from the start codon). Note if MgrB and PmrB are present and not truncated then nothing about them will be reported in the 'Col' column.
* OmpK35 and OmpK36 truncations and point mutations shown to result in reduced susceptibility to beta-lactamases. This information will be reported in the ``Omp_mutations`` column (truncations are expressed as % amino acid length from the start codon). Note if these core genes are present and not truncated then nothing about them will be reported in the 'Omp' column. The specific effect of OmpK mutations on drug susceptibility depends on multiple factors including what combinations of OmpK35 and OmpK36 alleles are present and what beta-lactamase genes are present (this is why we report them in their own column separate to Bla genes). See e.g. `paper <https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1007218>`_ and `this one <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11756-y>`_ for more information on OmpK genes and drug resistance.

Note these do not count towards acquired resistance gene counts, but do count towards drug classes (with the exception of Omp mutations, whose spectrum of effects depends on the presence of acquired beta-lactamases and thus their impact on specific beta-lactam drug classes is hard to predict).

Resistance scores and counts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Running the KpSC AMR module automatically runs additional modules for generating counts of resistance genes and drug classes, and calculating a resistance score. These modules can also be specified manually as follows:

.. code-block:: Python

   -m klebsiella_pneumo_complex__resistance_score, klebsiella_pneumo_complex__resistance_gene_count, klebsiella_pneumo_complex__resistance_class_count


Resistance score
""""""""""""""""

This module calculates a resistance score, which ranges from 0 to 3 as follows

.. list-table::

   * - 0
     - no ESBL, no carbapenemase (regardless of colistin resistance)

   * - 1
     - ESBL, no carbapenemase (regardless of colistin resistance)

   * - 2
     - Carbapenemase without colistin resistance (regardless of ESBL genes or OmpK mutations)

   * - 3
     - Carbapenemase with colistin resistance (regardless of ESBL genes or OmpK mutations)

Resistance gene counts and drug class counts
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This module quantifies how many acquired resistance genes are present and how many drug classes (in *addition* to ampicillin to which KpSC are intrinsically resistant) have at least one resistance determinant detected (i.e. ignoring genes recorded in the Bla_chr and Bla_acquired columns). 

A few things to note:

* The presence of resistance *mutations*\ , and non-ESBL forms of core genes SHV/LEN/OKP, do not contribute to the resistance *gene* count.
* Mutations do contribute to the drug class count, e.g. fluoroquinolone resistance will be counted if a GyrA mutation is encountered regardless of whether or not an acquired quinolone resistance (\ *qnr*\ ) gene is also present. The exceptions are Omp mutations, which do not contribute to the drug class count as their effect depends on the strain background and the presence of acquired beta-lactamase enzymes; hence this information is provided in a separate column, and interpretation is left to the user (see the `Antimicrobial Resistance <https://github.com/katholt/Kleborate/wiki/Antimicrobial-resistance>`_ page).
* Genes reported in the ``truncated_resistance_genes`` and ``spurious_resistance_genes`` columns do not contribute to the counts.
* Note that since a drug class can have multiple resistance determinants, the gene count is typically higher than the class count.


Resistance scores and counts outputs
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Resistance scores and counts are output in the following columns:

.. list-table::

   * - resistance_score
     - Score of 0-3, as defined above

   * - num_resistance_genes
     - Number of acquired resistance genes

   * - num_resistance_classes
     - Number of drug classes to which resistance determinants have been acquired (in addition to intrinsic ampicillin)


KpSC K and O locus typing with Kaptive
-----------------------------------------

.. code-block:: Python

   -m klebsiella_pneumo_complex__kaptive

This module will run the `Kaptive <https://github.com/klebgenomics/kaptive>` v3 tool to identify capsule (K) and O antigen loci. See the Kaptive `documentation <https://kaptive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>` for more details of how Kaptive works, tutorials, and citations.

Kaptive parameters
+++++++++++++++++++

``-t , --threads``

Number of threads for alignment (default: 1)


Kaptive outputs

Kaptive results are output in the following columns:

.. list-table::

   * - xx

   * - xx
     - xx


KpSC Wzi typing for K antigen prediction
-----------------------------------------

.. code-block:: Python

   -m klebsiella_pneumo_complex__wzi

This module reports the closest match amongst the *wzi* alleles in the `BIGSdb <http://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/klebsiella/klebsiella.html>`_. This is a marker of capsule locus (KL) type, which is predictive of capsule (K) serotype. Although there is not a 1-1 relationship between *wzi* allele and KL/K type, there is a strong correlation (see `Wyres et al, MGen 2016 <http://mgen.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/mgen/10.1099/mgen.0.000102>`_ and `Brisse et al, J Clin Micro 2013 <https://jcm.asm.org/content/51/12/4073.long>`_). Note the *wzi database* is populated with alleles from the *Klebsiella pneumoniae* species complex and is not reliable for other species.

The *wzi* allele can provide a handy way of spotting the hypervirulence-associated capsule types (wzi=K1, wzi2=K2, wzi5=K5); or spotting capsule switching within clones, e.g. you can tell which ST258 lineage you have from the _wzi_ type (wzi154: the main lineage II; wzi29: recombinant lineage I; others: probably other recombinant lineages). But the K locus predictions from the Kaptive module are more specific and reliable.

Wzi outputs
+++++++++++++++

Wzi typing results are output in the following columns:

.. list-table::

   * - wzi
     - wzi allele

   * - K_locus
     - K locus typically associated with this wzi allele

=====================================

.. code-block:: Python

   --preset kosc

These modules will be run if the ``enterobacterales__species``\   module confirms the input assembly as a member of the *K. oxytoca* species complex (KpSC) labelled in the tree above, and listed in the table below. 

.. list-table::

   * - Klebsiella oxytoca

   * - Klebsiella grimontii

   * - Klebsiella michiganensis

   * - Klebsiella pasteurii

   * - Klebsiella huaxiensis

   * - Klebsiella spallanzanii


KoSC MLST
---------

.. code-block:: Python

   -m klebsiella_oxytoca_complex__mlst

Genomes identified as belonging to the *K. oxytoca* species complex are subjected to MLST using the 7-locus scheme described at the  *K. oxytoca* `\at PubMLST <https://pubmlst.org/organisms/klebsiella-oxytoca>`_.

A copy of the MLST alleles and ST definitions is stored in the /data directory of this module.

++++++++++++++++++++++

``--klebsiella_oxytoca_complex__mlst_min_identity`` 

Minimum alignment percent identity for klebsiella_oxytoca_complex MLST (default: 90.0)

``--klebsiella_oxytoca_complex__mlst_min_coverage`` 

Minimum alignment percent coverage for klebsiella_oxytoca_complex MLST (default: 80.0)

.. list-table::

   * - ST
     - sequence type

   * - gapA, infB, mdh, pgi, phoE, rpoB, tonB
     - allele number

* Kleborate makes an effort to report the closest matching ST if a precise match is not found.
* Imprecise allele matches are indicated with a ``*``.
* Imprecise ST calls are indicated with ``-nLV``\ , where n indicates the number of loci that disagree with the ST reported. So ``258-1LV`` indicates a single-locus variant (SLV) of ST258, i.e. 6/7 loci match ST258.


KoSC virulence typing
---------------------
Genomes identified as belonging to the *K. oxytoca* species complex are subjected to typing for yersiniabactin, colibactin, aerobactin, salmochelin and rmp loci, using the following modules:

.. code-block:: Python

   -m klebsiella__ybst, klebsiella__cbst, klebsiella__abst, klebsiella__smst, klebsiella__rmst

These modules were primarily designed for typing of *K. pneumoniae* species complex, and the databases are populated from variation detected in KpSC genomes. However they can appear in KoSC genomes and so typing is included in the KoSC preset.


Escherichia
===========

.. code-block:: Python

   --preset escherichia

These modules will be run if the ``enterobacterales__species``\   module confirms the input assembly as a member of the *Escherichia* genus.
